    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Crème brûlée is a decadent French dessert consisting of a custard base and a caramelized sugar crust. </p>
    <p>The treat is traditionally served in individual ramekins.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Egg yolks:</b> This classic crème brûlée recipe starts with egg yolks, ensuring a rich dessert.</li>
        <li><b>White sugar:</b> You'll need six tablespoons of white sugar — four for the custard and two for the caramelized topping.</li>
        <li><b>Vanilla: </b> A dash of vanilla extract adds complexity and enhances the overall flavor of this crème brûlée.</li>
        <li><b>Cream: </b> Heavy whipping cream is whisked into the egg yolks over low heat until nice and thick.</li>
        <li><b>Brown sugar: </b> A blend of white and brown sugars is sprinkled over the custard and broiled until perfectly caramelized.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Make the custard: </b> Whisk the egg yolks, sugar, and vanilla in a bowl. Heat the cream until it's almost boiling, then whisk the cream into the egg mixture. Pour the mixture into a double boiler and stir over simmering water until thick.</li>
        <li><b>Bake and chill the custard: </b> Pour the mixture into crème brûlée dishes or ramekins. Bake in a preheated oven until set. Cool to room temperature, then chill in the fridge.</li>
        <li><b>Caramelize the sugar: </b> Sprinkle each custard with a blend of brown and white sugars. Place under your oven's broiler until the sugar is melted and caramelized. Chill before serving.</li>
    </ol>
