# odin-recipes
The Odin Project. Foundations Course. Project: Recipes

In this project I will demonstrate my basic HTML skills, which I have gained
during my participation in The Odin Project. I am supposed to demonstrate using HTML boilerplate, 
as well as creating various headings, paragraphs, ordered/unordered lists, adding images. 

At the end of my project, I will have a basic HTML page with basic elements. I will complete it later.
